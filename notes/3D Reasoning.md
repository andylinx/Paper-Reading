### Reasoning3D - Grounding and  Reasoning in 3D: Fine-Grained Zero-Shot Open-Vocabulary 3D Reasoning  Part Segmentation via Large Vision-Language Models

1. Introduce a new task: introduce a new task: **Zero-Shot** 3D Reasoning Segmentation for parts searching and localization for objects

â€‹		This ability can be used in the field of robotics, object manipulation.

2. introduce an approach to leverage off-the-shelf 2D models to perform the task in a zero-manner

Asking a system to perform more nuanced operations like "segment edible parts of a fruit" requires a level of contextual understanding and reasoning that current methods do not possess.
